# ranthropicR: R Interface to Anthropic Claude AI Models

## Overview

ranthropicR provides an R interface to Anthropic's Claude AI models, allowing you to integrate Claude's capabilities into your R workflows. This package supports text generation, chat-based interactions, and comes with a convenient RStudio addin for interactive use.

## Features

- Access to all available Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Support for both text completions and chat-based interactions
- Full control over generation parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- Interactive RStudio addin for easy chat with Claude
- Environment variable support for API key management

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DrPedroEmanuel/ranthropicR")
```

## Authentication

You'll need an API key from Anthropic. You can set it in your environment:

```r
Sys.setenv(ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here")
```

For security, consider adding this to your `.Renviron` file or using the `dotenv` package.

## Basic Usage

```r
library(ranthropicR)

# Initialize client
client <- anthropic_client()

# List available models
models <- list_models(client)
print(models)

# Select a model
client <- select_model(client, "claude-3.5-sonnet-20240307")

# Generate text
response <- generate_text(
  client, 
  prompt = "Human: Explain R programming language in simple terms.\n\nAssistant:",
  max_tokens = 500,
  temperature = 0.7
)

# Chat interface
messages <- list(
  list(role = "user", content = "Explain R programming language in simple terms.")
)

response <- chat(
  client,
  messages = messages,
  temperature = 0.7
)

print(response)
```

## Using the RStudio Addin

The package includes an RStudio addin that provides a graphical interface for interacting with Claude:

1. Install the package
2. In RStudio, go to Addins â†’ Claude Assistant
3. Enter your API key (or have it set in your environment)
4. Select your preferred model and parameters
5. Start chatting with Claude!
